# Bookly â€” FastAPI Backend for Scalable Web Applications

A **production-grade backend system** using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Celery. Built with modern software practices, security standards, and deployment readiness.
---

This backend demonstrates:

- FastAPI (async Python framework)
- PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy ORM
- JWT Authentication with token refresh & blacklist
- Redis for token blacklisting and caching
- Celery for background email tasks
- Email verification & password reset flows
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Alembic for database migrations
- Modular & scalable code structure
